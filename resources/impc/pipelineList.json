Weights are recorded daily and any mice that have lost greater than 20% or that exhibit clinical signs are sacrificed. At day 14-post infection half the mutants and wild type controls are sacrificed with spleen, liver and caecal contents collected. Bacterial counts in the organs are determined by serial plating and portion of the spleen and liver are formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. At day 28-post infection the remaining mutants are sacrificed and processed as above. In addition blood is collected by cardiac puncture and anti-TETc antibodies in the serum are determined by ELISA for total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a.",
