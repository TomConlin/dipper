the below is superceeded  as of 2019 Dec.
the files are now generated in the ncbigene section of DipperCache Makefile


#################################################################
Note the gene_info file is over 400 Meg compressed
it should not be fetched often or be allowed to slip into the dipper repo


wget --timestamping ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_info.gz


once the file is fetched, we can split off the species we are interested in

zgrep "^9796[^0-9]" gene_info.gz | gzip > Equus_caballus.gene_info.gz
zgrep "^9940[^0-9]" gene_info.gz | gzip > Ovis_aries.gene_info.gz
zgrep "^8022[^0-9]" gene_info.gz | gzip > Oncorhynchus_mykiss.gene_info.gz


currently storing these file in

    dipper/resources/animalqtldb/

it is originally about 3 Meg for three species

du -sh ./resources/animalqtldb/
3.1M    ./resources/animalqtldb/

Maybe it should go off into the data boutique

gene_info                                       recalculated daily
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           tab-delimited
           one line per GeneID
           Column header line is the first line in the file.
           Note: subsets of gene_info are available in the DATA/GENE_INFO
                 directory (described later)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tax_id:
           the unique identifier provided by NCBI Taxonomy
           for the species or strain/isolate

GeneID:
           the unique identifier for a gene
           ASN1:  geneid

Symbol:
           the default symbol for the gene
           ASN1:  gene->locus

LocusTag:
           the LocusTag value
           ASN1:  gene->locus-tag

Synonyms:
           bar-delimited set of unofficial symbols for the gene

dbXrefs:
           bar-delimited set of identifiers in other databases
           for this gene.  The unit of the set is database:value.
           Note that HGNC and MGI include 'HGNC' and 'MGI', respectively,
           in the value part of their identifier.  Consequently,
           dbXrefs for these databases will appear like:
             HGNC:HGNC:1100
             This would be interpreted as database='HGNC', value='HGNC:1100'
           Example for MGI:
             MGI:MGI:104537
             This would be interpreted as database='MGI', value='MGI:104537'

chromosome:
           the chromosome on which this gene is placed.
           for mitochondrial genomes, the value 'MT' is used.

map location:
           the map location for this gene

description:
           a descriptive name for this gene

type of gene:
           the type assigned to the gene according to the list of options
           provided in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects/entrezgene/entrezgene.asn


Symbol from nomenclature authority:
            when not '-', indicates that this symbol is from a
            a nomenclature authority

Full name from nomenclature authority:
            when not '-', indicates that this full name is from a
            a nomenclature authority

Nomenclature status:
            when not '-', indicates the status of the name from the
            nomenclature authority (O for official, I for interim)

Other designations:
            pipe-delimited set of some alternate descriptions that
            have been assigned to a GeneID
            '-' indicates none is being reported.

Modification date:
            the last date a gene record was updated, in YYYYMMDD format

Feature type:
            pipe-delimited set of annotated features and their classes or
            controlled vocabularies, displayed as feature_type:feature_class
            or feature_type:controlled_vocabulary, when appropriate; derived
            from select feature annotations on RefSeq(s) associated with the
            GeneID
