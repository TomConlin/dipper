# expects two graphviz dot digraph files;
# by convention "old"  then "new"
# for color to mean;  orange lost in "new" and blue gained in "new"
# with simple node names ('C-lang' variable naming conventions)
# edge's unadorned predicate label
# concludes with a space then count in parens
#
# For example:
# NODE1 -> NODE2 [label=<curie:term ! label (42)>];
#
# where the " ! label " is optional, but the lable _could_ have parens
#
# filter for edges in each file associate the count with the edge
# if an edge is common between the files
# then change its "count" to the difference. (second minus first)
# otherwise leave count as is
# UNLESS there is a parameter NOCOUNTS not equal to 0
# in which case set all counts the same
# this is for use when the counts have no meaning
# such as with random samples
